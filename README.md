# NFC Pi Password Project

## Preamble

This project aims to create a hardware based password manager... at least as far as the system receiving the password is
concerned. The problem I'm facing is that my password manager of choice works well in the vast majority of circumstances
but I need it to work for me even in the outlying circumstances. I'm just annoyed is all, lol. My environment consists
of several different systems running Windows, Linux and MacOS and I'd like to have a solution that works with each one. 
In fact, several of my linux systems have encrypted drives and I'd like the password manager to handle that as well. The
only way I can envision this all working is to create a "keyboard" that types the password for me... So, that's what I
aim to create.
